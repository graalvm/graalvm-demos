# OCI Native Generative AI Example

This example illustrates how to use the Generative AI service provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
It uses a state-of-the-art, customizable large language model to generate text.

The [source code](./src/main/java/com/oracle/labs/GenerateTextExample.java) is a self-contained demonstration of using a [`GenerativeAiInferenceClient`](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/tools/java/latest/com/oracle/bmc/generativeaiinference/GenerativeAiInferenceClient.html) to generate text, based on a prompt.

The [_pom.xml_](pom.xml) file includes necessary dependents (such as the [OCI Java SDK](https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/javasdk.htm)) and configures the build, including the [Native Maven Plugin](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html) to generate a native executable with GraalVM Native Image.

> For more information, see [Generative AI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm).

## Prerequisites
* [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).
* You must have access to access to Generative AI resources in your tenancy/compartment.
(For more information, see [Getting Access to Generative AI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/iam-policies.htm).)

## Preparing Your Code

Download or clone the GraalVM demos repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
```

Edit the contents of [_GenerateTextExample.java_](./src/main/java/com/oracle/labs/GenerateTextExample.java) as follows:

1. Update the value of the static variable `CONFIG_PROFILE` with the name of your OCI profile name.

2. Update the value of the static variable `COMPARTMENT_ID` with the OCID of a compartment that has access to Generative AI resources.
(For more information, see [Finding the OCID of a Compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport_topic-Locating_Oracle_Cloud_Infrastructure_IDs.htm#Finding_the_OCID_of_a_Compartment).)

Alternatively, you can follow the steps in [Generate Text in Generative AI](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/use-playground-generate.htm):

* (Optional) Enter your own prompt&mdash;you can edit this in the source code later.
* (Optional) Set values for the parameters&mdash;you can adjust these in the source code later.
* When you are happy with your prompt and the output, click **View code**, select **Java** as the programming language, then click **Copy code**, paste the code into the file named _GenerateTextExample.java_ and save it.
    > Your code should resemble [_GenerateTextExample.java_](./src/main/java/com/oracle/labs/GenerateTextExample.java).

## Running Your Code

Run the following command:

```shell
mvn install exec:java
```

This command runs the `main()` method in _GenerateTextExample.java_ and generates a response based on the prompt and parameters of the request.
The response should resemble the following:
```

## Running the Example as Native Executable

1. Create a native executable by running the following command:
    ```shell
    mvn clean package -Pnative
    ```

2. Run the native executable as shown below. (The response should resemble the one above.):
    ```shell
    ./target/generative-ai
    ```
