GraalVM on AWS Lambda Demo
====================
This demo will walk you through the processes for deploying both Java 21 and Native Image applications onto the AWS Lambda platform. In this demo, you will deploy a simple "Hello World" HTTP application and have the ability to compare how the versions of the application compare based on speed and size.

Prerequisites
----------------------
Ensure that you have the following installed and follow the linked instructions for any that you are missing:
- A Docker-API compatible container runtime such as [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/)
  - Ensure that the daemon is actively running before beginning the demo

**COMPATIBILITY**: Please note that this demo must be performed on an x86-based platform in order to properly function. Working through this demo on an ARM-based platform will result in the generation of a native executable that is not compatible with the platform.

Download or clone the GraalVM demos repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
```

Micronaut "Hello World" Application
----------------------
The code provided in this demo is a simple "Hello World" REST application created using the Micronaut &reg; framework. To understand what the code is doing, take a look at the _HelloController.java_ file:

**HelloController.java**

```java
package example.micronaut;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Map;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @Get
    public Map<String, Object> index() {
        return Collections.singletonMap("message", "Hello World");
    }
}
```

This code implements the actual RESTful "Hello World" functionality and is the code that snippet which is executed when a request is made to Lambda function. It produces the "Hello World" string when a GET request is made to the function's URL.

Deploying as a Java 21 Application (.jar)
----------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for this demo:
```sh
cd graalvm-demos/native-aws-lambda
```
2. Generate the .jar application file by executing the following command (the file will be created in native-aws-lambda/target/lambda-demo-0.1.jar):
```sh
./mvnw package
```
3. Sign-in to [Amazon Web Services](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ca-central-1#/discover) and navigate to the Lambda dashboard
4.	Select the “Create function” button in the top-right corner

![AWS dashboard](img/Create%20function.png)

5.	Select “Author from scratch”, choose a name for your function, select “Java 21 as the runtime, and select “x86_64” as the architecture, then click the "Create function" button

![Create function](img/myFunction.png)

6.	On the page for your newly created function, navigate to the section titled “Code source” and select the “Upload from .zip or.jar file” button

![Code upload](img/JAR%20upload.png)

7.	Click upload and navigate to where you stored the function.jar file that you downloaded then select “upload” and “save”
8.	Under “Runtime settings”, click “Edit” and input “io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautLambdaHandler” as the Handler

9.	Now you can go ahead and test the function. To do so, navigate to the “Test” tab and select “Create new event”. Choose a name for your test and input the following as the contents of the “Event JSON” box:
```sh
{
  "path": "/",
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
}
```

10.	Click “Save” in the top-right corner to save your test and click “Test” to ensure that the application works correctly. You should receive an output that indicates a success and provides information about the performance of the application:

**Cold Start**

**Warm Start**

Deploying as a Native Image Application
----------------------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for this demo:
```sh
cd graalvm-demos/native-aws-lambda
```
2. AWS Lambda requires a bootstrap file that provides instructions for running applications with custom runtimes. Generate a zip file containing the Native Image executable and a corresponding bootstrap file with the following command (the file will be created in native-aws-lambda/target/function.zip):
```sh
./mvnw package -Dpackaging=docker-native
```
3. Sign-in to [Amazon Web Services](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ca-central-1#/discover) and navigate to the Lambda dashboard

![AWS dashboard](img/Create%20function.png)

4.	Select the “Create function” button in the top-right corner
5.	Select “Author from scratch”, choose a name for your function, select “Provide your own bootstrap on Amazon Linux 2” as the runtime, and choose “x86_64” as the architecture

![Create function](img/myNativeImageFunc.png)

6.	On the page for your newly created function, navigate to the section titled “Code source” and select the “Upload from .zip file” button

![Code upload](img/zip%20upload.png)

7.	Click upload and navigate to where you stored the function.zip file that you created then select “upload” and “save”
8.	Under “Runtime settings”, click “Edit” and input “io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautLambdaHandler” as the Handler

![Runtime settings](img/handler%20linux.png)

9.	Now you can go ahead and test the function. To do so, navigate to the “Test” tab and select “Create new event”. Choose a name for your test and input the following as the contents of the “Event JSON” box:
```sh
{
  "path": "/",
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
}
```
![Test code](img/myTest.png)

10.	Click “Save” in the top-right corner to save your test and click “Test” to ensure that the application works correctly. You should receive an output that indicates a success and provides information about the performance of the application:

**Cold Start**

![Cold Start](img/native%20cold.png)

**Warm Start**

![Warm Start](img/native%20warm.png)

*Note that compared to the .jar version in the first section, the native executable performs a massively faster cold start performance and an overall reduction in memory usage!*

Clean-Up
--------------------------
After completing this demo, follow these steps to delete the resources created:
1. Sign-in to [Amazon Web Services](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ca-central-1#/discover) and navigate to the Lambda dashboard
2. Check the box next to the function(s) that you created
3. Click "Delete" under the "Actions" dropdown and follow the on-screen instructions
