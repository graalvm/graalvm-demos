GraalVM on Google Cloud Run Demo
================================
This demo will walk you through the processes for deploying Native Image applications onto the Google Cloud Run platform. In this demo, you will deploy a simple "Hello World" HTTP application and have the ability to see details about its performance.

Prerequisites
----------------------
Ensure that you have the following installed and follow the linked instructions for any that you are missing:
- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
- Google Cloud CLI: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#linux
- GraalVM: https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/

Download or clone GraalVM demos repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
    ```

Deploying a Native Image Application
----------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for this demo:
```bash
cd graalvm-demos/google-cloud-run
```
2. Login to your Google account using the Google Cloud CLI:
```
gcloud auth login
```
3. Run the following command to configure Docker credentuals for the CLI:
```
gcloud auth configure-docker
```
4. Create a new project using the following command, where "xxxxxx" denotes the 6-digit identifier you choose for your project:
```
gcloud projects create graal-demo-xxxxxx
```
5. Set your newly created project to be currently selected:
```
gcloud config set project graal-demo-xxxxxx
```
To see a list of all projects use:
```
gcloud projects list
```
6. Use a browser to login to the Google Cloud dashboard and navigate to the [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects) tab
7. Ensure that you have a billing account set up and enable billing for the newly created project by clicking on the dots beside the project name and selecting "Change billing"

8. Back on your terminal interface, activate the required project APIs:
```
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com
```
9. Push the application image to Google Cloud Container Registry (once again replacing "xxxxxx" as appropriate):
```
./mvnw deploy -Dpackaging=docker-native -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/graal-demo-xxxxxx/graaldemo:latest
```
