# Deployment: Infrastructure as code

The scripts in this folder give the ability to provision and manage compute capacity using [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/services.htm), in
order to deploy the docker container and run the GraalVM demos in it. 

In short the scripts does the below:
- create computes instances and associated 
network resources necessary to run an instance on OCI
- creates a virtual network with a subnet and puts one host on this subnet
- adds the necessary permissions to allow services to communicate in the subnet within specific ports (egress and ingress rules)
- runs the `init.sh` script to install basic tool(s) on the hosts 
- finally, the `provision.sh` script to prepare the instance ready to be used -- by triggering the docker container to stand up the Jupyter labs server
- also provides the necessary help in the form of ready-to-use shell-scripts toto perform various tasks with the help of `terraform` and `ssh`

## Pre-requisites

- **A [Oracle Cloud (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) Account (you maybe able to procure some FREE credits via the [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) program)**
- A properly configured [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm). See [Ensure OCI account is created and you can log in](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/PaaSprereqs.htm)
Note: the above step is one-off, you won't need to do this everything we run instances on the Oracle Cloud. But do ensure the minimum prerequisites are fulfilled.
- [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) (all methods for the various platforms are mentioned)
- Clone this repo and in the right folder:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
$ cd deployments/oci
```
- Create your credentials file (one-off, you can reuse this for future purposes) in the `examples/tribuo/deployments/oci` folder. Use the `credentials.rc_template` to create your own credentials file for your OCI account. The file should look like the below (as per the `credentials.rc_template` file provided):

```bash
### Terraform env variables
export TF_VAR_tenancy_ocid=[TENANCY_OCID]
export TF_VAR_compartment_ocid=[COMPARMENT_OCID]
export TF_VAR_user_ocid=[USER_OCID]
export TF_VAR_fingerprint=[FINGERPRINT]
export TF_VAR_private_key_path=[PATH_TO_YOUR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY eg: ~/.oci/key.pem]
export TF_VAR_region=[REGION NAME eg: uk-london-1]

### ssh keys that will be used for remote access authenication
export TF_VAR_ssh_public_key="$(cat [PATH_TO_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY])"

## We won't be assigning the private_key contents into an environment variable but pass it as an argument via the CLI
echo 'Pass -var "ssh_private_key=$(cat [PATH_TO_YOUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY])" when running the "terraform apply" or "terraform destory" commands'
```
Note the `TF_VAR` prefix, as it is a terraform convention for input variables. 

Here is a list of resources on where to look for each of the above resources:

- [Refer to this link](https://cloud.oracle.com/tenancy)  to find out about `[TENANCY_OCID]` (look for the **OCID** field under the Tenancy Information on the page)
- Use the left-hand [Navigation menu > Identity > Compartments](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/compartments), select the compartment to find out about `[COMPARMENT_OCID]` where you should look for the **OCID** field
- Go to `Profile Icon` > `User Settings` or left-hand [Navigation menu > Identity > Users](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/users) > Select the user from the list (yourself), look for the **OCID** field to find out about `[USER_OCID]`
- Go to [Navigation menu > Identity > Users](https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/users) > Select the user from the list (yourself), then from under **Resource**, click on **API Keys > Add API Key**. Here you can choose to either generate a new key-pair or use an existing one (choose the Public key file or paste it's content), once done, you are shown the finger print for the `[TF_VAR_fingerprint]` variable
- And depending on the above choice, make sure you note the location of the Private key of the key-pair from the above selection, this is needed for `[TF_VAR_private_key_path]`
Other resources [1](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five) | [2](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two) | [3](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#four) | [4](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five) (look for How to Upload the Public Key)
- Refer to [Regions page](https://cloud.oracle.com/regions/infrastructure) to look for the Region Identifier that is relevant to your account for the `[TF_VAR_region]` field
- `[TF_VAR_ssh_public_key]` and `[TF_VAR_ssh_private_key]` are already known to you, they are referring to the contents of the keys in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` files respectively.

For a summary (also helps to verify the steps) of the above steps please see [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/oci/index.html).

## Provisioning Infrastructure using Terraform

### Setting up credentials

- Source your credentials file

```bash
$ source credentials.rc
```

### Create infrastructure from the CLI using Terraform

- Deploy with terraform

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply -var "ssh_private_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" --auto-approve
```

The deployment process should end with a list of private/public ip addresses like so:

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 9 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_private_ips = [
    10.1.nn.m
]
instance_public_ips = [
    1xx.145.174.85
]

```

The public IP addresses are fairly dynamic in nature and could be between any range (example shown above). Please make a note of the Public IP above as it will be needed in the following steps.

### Deploy the docker image in the cloud

- use ssh and docker to make that end meet

```bash
$ ./run-docker-container-in-the-cloud.sh
```

An alternative way to find out the Public IP(s) of the created resources are:

```bash
$ ./get-instance-public-ip.sh
```

### Recover/retry from failed attempt

- Apply the fix to the configuration or script or both
- And run the below again:

```bash
$ terraform apply -var "ssh_private_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" --auto-approve
```

### Start clean after a failed attempt (errors encountered)

- Run the below before proceeding:

```bash
$ terraform destroy -var "ssh_private_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" --auto-approve
$ terraform apply -var "ssh_private_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" --auto-approve
```

This is particularly important on OCI when one or more resources did not get created and before trying again we should clean-up or else Terraform may try to recreate an already existing (invalid instance) resource and you could get errors like "Service rate limit exceeded".

### Destroy infrastructure (cleanup)

- Remove resources or destroy them with terraform

```bash
$ terraform destroy -var "ssh_private_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" --auto-approve
```

You should see something like this at the end of a successful run:

```text
.
.
.
Destroy complete! Resources: 7 destroyed.
```

### Security

Note that this setup does not take into account establishing a secure `http` i.e. `https` communication between VM/Docker instances and the browser. Please beware when using this in your target domain depending on the prerequisites you need to conform to. This example is good for learning and illustration purposes, please do NOT deploy it in production or public facing environments. The current instance is for learning, illustration and demonstration purposes only.
