# Micronaut Hello World REST App with GraalVM Enterprise in OCI Cloud Shell

This sample shows how you can get started quickly with GraalVM Enterprise Edition in Oracle Cloud Infrastructre (OCI) Cloud Shell. This sample uses a simple hello world REST application built with the Micronaut framework and GraalVM Enterprise Native Image and JDK (Java Development Kit).

## What is GraalVM?

[GraalVM](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/graalvm/) is a high-performance JDK distribution that accelerates Java workloads. GraalVM Native Image ahead-of-time compilation builds your Java application into a native executable that is small, starts fast, and uses less memory and CPU. Leading Java microservices frameworks such as Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus and Helidon support GraalVM Native Image.

GraalVM Enterprise Edition is available for use on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) at no additional cost.

## What is Micronaut?

[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) is a modern, JVM-based framework to build modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. By avoiding runtime reflection in favor of annotation processing, Micronaut improves the Java-based development experience by detecting errors at compile time instead of runtime, and improves Java-based application start time and memory footprint. Micronaut includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation time making it a great fit for working with databases like MySQL, Oracle Autonomous Database, etc.

Micronaut uses GraalVM Native Image to build lightweight Java applications that use less memory and CPUs, are smaller and faster because of an advanced ahead-of-time compilation technology.

## What is Cloud Shell?

[Cloud Shell](https://www.oracle.com/devops/cloud-shell/) is a free-to-use browser-based terminal accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console. It provides access to a Linux shell with preinstalled developer tools and a pre-authenticated OCI CLI. You can use the shell to interact with OCI resources, follow labs and tutorials, and quickly run utility commands.

GraalVM Enterprise JDK 17 and Native Image are preinstalled in Cloud Shell, so you don’t have to install and configure a development machine to get started.

## Step 1: Launch Cloud Shell 

1. [Login to OCI Console and launch Cloud Shell](https://cloud.oracle.com/?bdcstate=maximized&cloudshell=true).

## Step 2: Select GraalVM as the current JDK 

1. List the installed JDKs:

    ```shell
    csruntimectl java list
    ```

    The output should be similar to:

    ```shell
      graalvmeejdk-17.0.4                                    /usr/lib64/graalvm/graalvm22-ee-java17
    * openjdk-11.0.15                   /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.15.0.9-2.0.1.el7_9.x86_64
      openjdk-1.8.0.332                /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.332.b09-1.el7_9.x86_64
    ```

2. Select GraalVM as the current JDK:

    ```shell
    csruntimectl java set graalvmeejdk-17.0.4
    ```

    The output should be similar to:

    ```shell
    The current managed java version is set to graalvmeejdk-17.0.4.
    ```

## Step 3: [OPTIONAL] Confirm Software Version and Environment Variables

This step is optional - [Check software version and environment variables](../_common/README-check-version-env-vars.md)


## Step 4: Setup Project and Run

1. Git clone this repo.

2. Build the app JAR

    ```shell
    mvn package
    ```

    **OR** 

    ```shell
    ./mvnw package
    ```

3. Run the app JAR in the background

    ```shell
    java -jar target/MnHelloRest-0.1.jar &
    ```

4. Test the app JAR

    4.1) Should output "Hello World"

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/
    ```

    4.2) Should output "Hello Micronaut"

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/Micronaut
    ```

5. Bring the running app JAR in the foreground

    ```shell
    fg
    ```

6. Once the app is running in the foreground, press CTRL+C to stop it.

7. Build the app native executable

    ```shell
    mvn package -Dpackaging=native-image
    ```

    **OR** 

    ```shell
    ./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image
    ```

8. Run the app native executable in the background

    ```shell
    ./target/MnHelloRest &
    ```

9. Test the app native executable

    9.1) Should output "Hello World"

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/
    ```

    9.2) Should output "Hello Micronaut-Graal-Native"

    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/Micronaut-Graal-Native
    ```

10. Bring the running app JAR in the foreground

    ```shell
    fg
    ```

11. Once the app is running in the foreground, press CTRL+C to stop it.
