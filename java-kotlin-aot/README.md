# GraalVM demos: Java Kotlin interop ahead-of-time compilation demo


This repository contains the code for a demo application for [GraalVM](graalvm.org).

## Prerequisites
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [GraalVM](http://graalvm.org)

## Preparation

Download or clone the repository and navigate into the `java-kotlin-aot` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/shelajev/graalvm-demos
cd graalvm-demos/java-kotlin-aot
```

This is a simple Java / Kotlin application, where a Java method accesses a String from Kotlin and calls a Kotlin function, which later accesses a String from a Java class. This example demonstrates how easy it is to interop between Java and Kotlin.

Before running this example, you need to build the application.

Note that you can use any JDK for building the app, but in the build script we refer to `javac` in the GraalVM to simplify the prerequisites and not depend on you having another JDK installed.

So export the GraalVM home directory as the `$GRAALVM_HOME` and add `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin` to the path. Here's what I have in my `~/.bashrc` on my MacBook, note that your paths are likely to be different depending on the download location.

```
GRAALVM_VERSION=1.0.0-rc11
export GRAALVM_HOME=/Users/${current_user}/repo/graal-releases/graalvm-$GRAALVM_VERSION/Contents/Home
```

Then execute:
```
./build.sh
```

Let's look at the important line of the `build.sh` which creates a native image from our Java application. The `native-image` utility is a part of GraalVM. It is used to compile applications ahead-of-time for faster starup and lower general overhead at runtime.

```
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image -cp ./target/mixed-code-hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -H:Name=helloworld -H:Class=hello.JavaHello -H:+ReportUnsupportedElementsAtRuntime --allow-incomplete-classpath
```

It takes a couple of parameters, the classpath, the main class of the application with the `-H:Class=...` and the name of the resulting executable with `-H:Name=...`.


After executing the `native-image` command, check the directory, it should have produced an executable file `helloworld`.

## Running the application

To run the application, you need to execute the fat jar file in the `target` dir. You can run it as a normal Java application using `java`. Or, since we have a native image prepared, you can run that directly.

The `run.sh` file executes it both ways and times them with the `time` utility.
```
time java -cp ./target/mixed-code-hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar hello.JavaHello
time ./helloworld
```

On my machine `run.sh` produces approximately the following output:
```
â†’ ./run.sh
+ java -cp ./target/mixed-code-hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar hello.JavaHello
Hello from Kotlin!
Hello from Java!

real	0m0.176s
user	0m0.119s
sys	0m0.039s
+ ./helloworld
Hello from Kotlin!
Hello from Java!

real	0m0.008s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
```

The performance gain of the native version is largely due to the faster startup.
